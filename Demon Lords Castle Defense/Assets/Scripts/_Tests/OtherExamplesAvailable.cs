    // Author: Glenn Storm
    // This holds an assortment of comments on additional example scripts available

    // I can provide examples in code for:

    // - The Effects System (we used to great advantage in Greener Pastures; very flexible way to add arbitrary rules to anything)
    // - Random Helper functions (shuffle, weighted random, gaussian random, etc.)
    // - Save/Load functions (auto-load/save, manage directories, etc.)
    // - Sound Capture
    // - Screenshot Capture
    // - Timer Helper functions (better than using coroutines; more useful everywhere)
    // - Pattern of using Data, System and Tool scripts together in architecture
